Get your AngularJS app sailing on the IPFS. In this short tutorial, we will learn how to create an Angular app and deploy it on Fleek so it can be shared through IPFS.

# Install Angular CLI

Before you can make any command work with any angular project or even run your angular project, you would have to install the `angular-cli` using the command below, this command installs the `angular-cli` globally on your system.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Creating an Angular Project

Once the first step is done, you would have to create an angular project using the command below

```
ng new your-app-name
```

This command will bootstrap a complete AngularJS app for you, you would also be prompted if you would like to add Angular routing, that should be a yes and also the kind of css style you would like to use, for example, CSS, SCSS, LESS, and the likes. You can see a picture of my process below

Once that is done creating the next step is to enter into the directory of the app you are working on using the command below

```
cd your-app-name
```

Start your angular project using the command below

```
ng serve --open
```

This command will start the Angular project and open up right away in your browser one the preview on `http://localhost:4200/` is ready.

# Push to GitHub and Linking Fleek

The first step is to push the Angular app to Github. That will allow Fleek to gain access to your project for the deployment.

In our case, I've pushed my project to this repo: https://github.com/Developerayo/angularjs-on-ipfs-on-fleek

Now, we must log to fleek and create a new site and click/find the repo you created

Luckily for us, Fleek has automatically detected our Angular project and filled the build settings with the right information, but the one thing you have to specifiy is the publish directory, which should be set to `dist/your-app-name.com`. Immediately that is set lick on `Deploy Site`. 

Let's wait a bit for the site to deploy. This should take no longer than a few minutes.

Upon deployment, Fleek will automatically assign a default URL to the site. 
Here is mine: https://calm-shape-3413.on.fleek.co
