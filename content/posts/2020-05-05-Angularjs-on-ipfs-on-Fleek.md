- Creating an Angular Project

# Install Angular CLI

Before you can make any comand work with any angular project or even run your own angular project, you would have to  install the `angular-cli` using the comand below, this comand installs the `angular-cli` globally on your system.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Creating an Angular Project

Once the first step is done, you would have to create an angular project using the comand below

```
ng new your-app-name
```

This comand will bootstarap a complete AngularJS app for you, you would also be prompted if you would like to add Angular routing, that should be a yes and also the kind of css style you would like to use for example, CSS, SCSS, LESS and the likes. You can see a picture of my process below

Once that is done creacting the next step is to enter into the directory of the app you are working on using the comand below

```
cd your-app-name
```
