Fleek listens!

Many have asked for it and now we deliver. We've added support for three new frameworks!

# Not one or two, but three!

![](https://fleekblog-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/new-frameworks/three-framework-meme.jpeg)

The three frameworks in question are Gridsome, Svelte and Mkdocs (which by the way we are using for[ our revamped docs](https://docs.fleek.co/)).

The support for these frameworks include auto-detection at the site creation stage and [official Fleek docker images](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/fleek/repositories) that you can use right away!
