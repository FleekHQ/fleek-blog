The Fleek protocols ranks grow again! Make room for **Handshake**, now supported in Fleek. You can add custom HNS domains for both IPFS & Internet Computer hosted websites and applications, seamlessly, and as easy as it is to set up DNS or ENS.

The peer-to-peer root naming system blockchain has a thriving community, and we're excited to make way for another alternative to centralized DNS that is blockchain-powered and has a focus on making unstoppable and user-owned naming a reality.

Plus, let's be real. We can't wait to see which hilarious custom TLDs you bring to Fleek.
