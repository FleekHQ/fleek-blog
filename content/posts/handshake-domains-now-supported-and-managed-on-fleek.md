Fleek's protocol ranks grow again! Make room for **Handshake**, the peer-to-peer root naming sytem blockchain. You can add **custom HNS domains for both IPFS & Internet Computer hosted sites and apps**, seamlessly, and as easy as it is to set up DNS or ENS.

Handshake has had amazing growth, and its thriving development and community blows us away each week with [dope news like the release of dLinks](https://www.namebase.io/blog/dlinks-launch/) by Namebase, or HNS support in the [Puma mobile browser](https://www.pumabrowser.com/)! We're pumped about welcoming the ecosystem into Fleek, and add another blockchain alternative to DNS, together with ENS (Ethereum Name Service), as they forge the road towards making unstoppable and user-owned naming a reality on the Open Web.

Plus, let's be honest. Owning top level domains is just cool and we can't wait to see what awesome domain+TLDs combos you bring on to Fleek.

## Handshake & Namebase

A blockchain-based naming protocol and certificate authority, and a fire registry to compliment it. Name a better duo. If you haven't had the chance yet to know Handshake, it's [time to catch up.](https://hsd-dev.org/) 

In a nutshell, it acts like a **decentralized extension of DNS' root zone file**, where the ownership data of the web's TLDs are stored.

But with the added perk that it is done through a decentralized blockchain system that's permissionless and uncensorable. **No middlemen or controllers**. Domain buyers own the top level domains, and no entity (ICANN) could snatch it away or avoid the registration of weird & creative TLDs (.mars, .moonmoon, .whatever). 

It's as if the current DNS registrar level was wiped, and TLD **owners in HNS would retake that role for themselves**, each being the registrar of their own TLDs and doing with them as they see fit (commercialize domains, sell, transfer, etc), validated and backed by a blockchain network.

Plus, it is **backwards compatible with ICANN's** root zone (.com, .org, etc.) to avoid conflicts with current DNS owners, who have their names and ownership reserved for their domains on HNS.

To top it all, HNS aims to peel off another important layer of trust/centralization of the web. Certificate authorities. Scrap centralized lists in hundreds of authorities for key authenticity verification (known to have gone rogue and compromised securit in the past) and replace it with a decentralized blockchain-based and cryptographically-backed key verification.

**Namebase** on the other hand, is a parallel project, a seamless front for HNS, a registry and marketplace app where you can purchase, sell or trade domains on the HNS blockchain. It's uses a simple bid/auction process for purchasing TLDs (emphasis on purchase, not rent).

You could operate and interact with [Handshake directly](https://hsd-dev.org/) via their native suite/node; Namebase is the abstraction of that process and a friendly web-platform alternative to installing installing a full Handshake node.
