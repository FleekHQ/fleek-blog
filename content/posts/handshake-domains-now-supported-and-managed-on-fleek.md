Fleek's protocol ranks grow again! Make room for **Handshake**, the peer-to-peer root naming sytem blockchain. You can add **custom HNS domains for both IPFS & Internet Computer hosted sites and apps**, seamlessly, and as easy as it is to set up DNS or ENS.

Handshake has a thriving community and we're excited to welcome them into the platform as another blockchain alternative to DNS. Together with ENS (Ethereum Name Service), they are forging the road towards making unstoppable and user-owned naming a reality on the Open Web.

Plus, let's be honest. Owning top level domains is just cool and we can't wait to see what hilarious and weird domain+TLDs combos you bring on to Fleek.
