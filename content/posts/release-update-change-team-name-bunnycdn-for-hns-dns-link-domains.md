It‚Äôs time for another quick release ‚ö° This week we‚Äôre bringing some changes to the Fleek.co platform, a little bit of adding here, some subtracting over there. As always, feel free to submit any requests or ideas to the team! üî•

What do we have in store this week?

* Added Changing Team Names (much requested, thank you guys!)
* Added BunnyCDN for HNS (we‚Äôre just hopping along aren‚Äôt we üê∞)
* Removed DNS Link for Internet Computer sites (no need for that!)
* Removed the ability to buy Domains on Fleek (more on this below üëá )

# New Features

**First off, the ability to change your team name!** This has been a much requested feature by the community and it‚Äôs finally seeing the light of day.

**Next up, we added BunnyCDN for HNS Domains** to get us hoppin‚Äô up to speed with our new content delivery platform for all Handshake domains. Lightning fast performance at scale with no sacrifice in decentralization? Yessir. You can learn more about these [CDN perks here](mailto:support@fleek.co).

# Removed

**We removed the DNS link setting for Internet Computer sites**, because -as we said earlier- it is unnecessary. Setting up a DNS link would allow you to map a DNS name to an IPFS hash, and access the latest version of your site through IPFS. It‚Äôs an IPFS only thing and it‚Äôs not necessary on the Internet Computer.

**We also removed the ability to buy domains through Fleek.** In the end, it is a matter of Fleek not being a full-on DNS management suite that can provide a solid user experience without added overhead. We believe it‚Äôs better if users buy domains from other services that have a great set of domain management tools already, and then point it to Fleek like most users do anyways.

This opens up the question of what does this mean for legacy users that bought domains through Fleek? ü§î

## What happens to Fleek-bought domains?

Legacy users! You can still use your Fleek-purchased domains, and if it‚Äôs been more than 60 days since you purchased it we can transfer the domain to a DNS provider of your choice. Just contact us through our support email (support@fleek.co) or Intercom in the app!
