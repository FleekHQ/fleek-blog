This release is a special one because its has been the most requested feature. It makes sense since so much of the Ethereum space uses IPFS for their sites and apps. This release brings the IPFS community ENS Domains!

# ENS Domain Support

You can now easily point an ENS domain to your IPFS site and automatically update for future deployments. We are all about the deployment and developer experience and thats why we have made this the most seamless flow possible. Just Add your ENS and make one transaction that makes us a "controller." ENS provides this role that fits perfectly for this type of experience. You continue to own your ENS domain with full control and just delegate the day to day operation to Fleek. [Check out](https://fleekhq.eth/) our homepage on ENS!

# Other Updates

We've released a few other bugs and enhancements while helping out current users on the platform. We pride ourselves in a great user experience including getting in touch with us and receiving support for Fleek whenever you need it. 

We are speaking about an even more major release next week at the [IPFS Pinning Summit](https://ipfspinningsummit.com/)! That has also been a major focus of ours since our last release and we're excited to share it soon. Through the rest of this week and next we already have some upgrades to the ENS experience we plan to release.
