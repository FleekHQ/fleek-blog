### With no central authority, Fleek Network is not only reliable but also censorship-resistant!

![](https://storageapi.fleek.co/fleek-team-bucket/Blogs/fleek-xyz-typeform-image.jpg)

Fast, performant, and most importantly, no intermediary ⚡

Fleek Network provides censorship resistance through a variety of means, including:

* Consensus
* Reward Mechanisms
* Content Addressability

In a decentralized network, it is absolutely crucial that no central authorities control the data.

Fleek Network’s main objective is to create a decentralized content delivery network that serves users their content and applications in a censorship-resistant, trustless manner, with no central authority controlling it, as opposed to the traditional content delivery network model.
