We just made some exciting enhancements to our Fleek.co platform that we wanted to share ⚡️ As always, user’s input drives the features we release. Keep on requesting so that we can keep on building 🚀

So what’s new this week?

* New Cloudflare CDN Option
* Change an Existing Site’s Repository

# New Features

## Cloudflare CDN Option

First on the docket, we’ve added the ability to use **Cloudflare for CDN/Cache/DNS** features instead of the default Fleek CDN/Cache layer. 

Don’t worry, you’ll still benefit from Fleek’s CI/CD pipeline for deploying to IPFS. For information on how to make this change to your site visit our Fleek Docs: [Setting Up CloudFlare](https://docs.fleek.co/domain-management/custom-dns-domains/#setting-up-cloudflare).

## Update Existing Site with a New Repo

Migrating your **already deployed site** **to a new Github repo**? With this new feature update, gone are the days of having to create an entirely new site through Fleek in order to do this. From your already deployed site, find your way to **Setting > Build & Deploy > Continuous Deployment > Edit Settings**. 

From here, select or search for your repository of interest. Boom, your existing site has now been populated with the build from your new Github repository. It's that easy!

## Wrapping it up 🗞️
