## Introduction

Our [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) [image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/) provides all the requirements to have Fleek Network running quickly üåà and the following guide will provide you a quick reference to get you started with Docker üî•!

If you need a deep dive into Docker, check the oficial getting started [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

As Fleek Network's repositories are in constant development and change, you should consider that the following guide was [checked in](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) to commit `60a37c62e`. While we try our best to update documentation and guides during development, there might be breaking changes which might take some time to reflect in our docs. To avoid disappointment, feel free to check into commit `60a37c62e` or contribute by getting in touch with us, or sending a PR in the relevant context üôè.

## Install Docker desktop

The simplest way to run docker is to visit the https://www.docker.com/, download and install Docker Desktop.

üí° Some users might prefer to look into the Docker daemon (dockerd), in that case check the [docs](https://docs.docker.com), as we're trying to keep it simple here!

Once Docker desktop is installed, you should start or open the application in your operating system! 

Also, you'll be able to run it via the CLI, as such:

```sh
docker -v
```
```
Docker version 20.10.6, build 370c289
```

Let's do the same for `docker-compose`

```sh
docker-compose -v
```

```sh
docker-compose version 1.29.1, build c34c88b2
```

üí° Versions might differ a bit from the time of writing.

The following command's output will indicate if Docker's working correctly:

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

```sh
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:faa03e786c97f07ef34423fccceeec2398ec8a5759259f94d99078f264e9d7af
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Run all the commands above in your terminal, to confirm üëç everything's working before proceeding to the next steps, please!

## Build the Docker image

We are assuming üòÖ that you've followed our [Fleek Network: Getting started guide](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/fleek-network-getting-started-guide) and have successfully cloned the `ursa` repository. If you haven't give it a go, before you proceed! The reason is that the image builder requires the source files as the input file to have information to build a container. The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/32928e78afa0bbed8241ddc4d7e2456752456fd6/Dockerfile) that is located in the Ursa repository (at time of writing), [here](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/32928e78afa0bbed8241ddc4d7e2456752456fd6/Dockerfile).

If you have cloned the project correctly, you should `change directory` to the project root directory.

```sh
cd <PATH-TO-URSA-DIRECTORY>
```

Example, ours is located at `/Users/fleek/ursa`:

```sh
cd /Users/fleek/ursa
```

At time of writing, this is how the project root looks like (e.g. use the [ls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls) to see the list):

```sh
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rust-toolchain.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ specs
```

> Double-check that your work directory is in the project root. You'll build the Docker image based in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/32928e78afa0bbed8241ddc4d7e2456752456fd6/Dockerfile).

When ready, run the Docker build command:

```sh
docker build -t ursa -f ./Dockerfile .
```

The build process takes awhile and you have to wait for completion. 

ü§ñ The output should be similar to:

```

 ```

‚ö†Ô∏è The Docker image is only required to be built once and/or, when changes are pulled from the remote repository, or versions you might be interested in! Otherwise, you're not required to build it everytime to run the node.

> Bear in mind that if you don't update your build often, you won't have the latest changes, which happen frequently with all the ongoing development! This is quite important to understand, as it causes confusion to some users. The Ursa application at time of writing does not update automatically.

## Run the Docker container

Once the Docker image is ready ‚úÖ, you can run it by providing a container and image name!

Since we want to interact with the process `ursa`, we'll run in interactive mode by using the flags `-it`.

```sh
docker run -p 4069:4069 --name ursa-cli -it ursa
```

We are providing a custom name of our liking (ursa-cli) for the container and the image name we have built previously (ursa).

```sh
docker run -p <HOST-PORT>:<CONTAINER-PORT> --name <CONTAINER-NAME> -it <IMAGE>
```

> üí° We understand these commands might be hard to remember and provide some utility commands for your convenience. Although, if you need naming, port customisation, then you can stick with the knowledge you've acquired, or use this document as a reference. The utility commands require [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html), most operating systems have it installed by default, otherwise you can use a web search engine to find instructions on how to install it in your operating system.

The utility commands are the `docker-build` and `docker-run`.

Respectively, execute `docker-build` to build the Docker image:

```sh
make docker-build
```

Execute the `docker-run` to run the Docker container based in the built image:

```sh
make docker-run
```

üí° Remember, the utility commands will use default naming and port numbers. Use the original Docker commands for better control or customisation.

If all goes well, the output should be similar to:

```sh

```

A few points to notice are the listener port number and hostname üëÄ. As described in the [Run the Docker container](#run-the-docker-container), the container listener port number is exposed to your host's port number.

Here's an example of a curl request for the http headers, as a quick healthcheck.

```sh
curl -I 127.0.0.1:4069
```

The output displays some http headers:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
content-length: 0
date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 17:09:16 GMT
```

For users who need high customisation üòé, the Docker port binding is an important concept to understand when working with containers üßê. For example, we can extend the previous `p` by providing.

```sh
-p <HOST-ADDRESS>:<CONTAINER-PORT>:<HOST-PORT>
```

Following up üëá, we'll look into how to control Ursa via the container's processes, to help you understand a bit more of Ursa. This can be useful, if you want to follow some of ursa subcommands explained in the [Fleek Network: Getting started guide](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/fleek-network-getting-started-guide), or if you need to interact with the process in the container:

- [Stop the Docker container](#stop-the-docker-container)
- [Restart the Docker container](#restart-the-docker-container)
- [Delete the Docker container](#delete-the-docker-container)
- [Execute bash shell in the container](#execute-bash-shell-in-the-container)
- [Stop the Docker container](#stop-the-docker-container)

If you are not interested in this level of control and detail üòπ, or rather check these later, you can skip to [running a stack with Docker compose](#running-a-stack-with-docker-compose), the simplest and opinionated way to start Ursa along other services to help you monitor, etc.

## Stop the Docker container

After you're done with the process ‚è≥, the Docker container can be stopped by:

```sh
docker stop <CONTAINER-NAME>
```

In our case, we'd like to stop `ursa-cli`:

```sh
docker stop ursa-cli
```

## Restart the Docker container

After the initial run of the project Dockerfile image, we can restart it by the container name:

```sh
docker start <CONTAINER-NAME>
```

Our container name is `ursa-cli`, so we do:

```sh
docker start ursa-cli
```

We haven't set any of the host or port number bindings, that information is part of the metadata of a container, which is immutable, it's persistant.

## Delete the Docker container

The Docker container can be removed by:

```sh
docker rm <CONTAINER-NAME>
```

For what matters to us, we'd like to delete `ursa-cli`:

```sh
docker rm ursa-cli
```

When we delete a container, it's no longer available and thus we'd have to [Docker run](#run-the-docker-container) üë∑.

## Execute Ursa CLI commands in the container

```sh
docker exec -it <CONTAINER-NAME> <FILEPATH> <ARGS>
```

For example, we'll interact with the container named `ursa-cli` and execute `ursa` which is located in the `/usr/local/bin`, with the flag `version` to get the version number of the `ursa cli` we are running.

```sh
docker exec -it ursa-cli ursa --version
```

If successfull, you'll get the version number (beware that version might differ from time of writing, as Ursa is in constant development).

```sh
ursa 0.1.0
```

## Execute bash shell in the container

Start the bash shell in the container:

```sh
docker exec -it <CONTAINER-NAME> bash
```

As we have `ursa-cli` for our container name example, do:

```sh
docker exec -it ursa-cli bash
```

üë©‚Äçüíª Here, we're just looking into how to execute a process in the container where host and port binding is still relevant and required to be applied, if you haven't, otherwise your host will not have the correct bindings. Bear in mind that Docker executes a process in the container, not your host!

For example, we could then check the `help` flag.

```sh
ursa --help
```

```sh
CLI options

USAGE:
    ursa [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -r, --rpc        Allow rpc to be active or not (default = true)
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <config>                  A toml file containing relevant configurations
    -d, --database-path <database-path>    Database path where store data
    -i, --identity <identity>              Identity name. If not provided, a default identity will be created and reused
                                           automatically
    -k, --keystore-path <keystore-path>    Path to the keystore directory. Defaults to ~/.config/ursa/keystore
    -r, --rpc-port <rpc-port>              Port used for JSON-RPC communication

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help    Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    rpc     run rpc commands from cli
```

üí° At time of writing the Docker build places the ursa binary in the pathname `/usr/local/bin`, making `ursa` globally executable. On previous Dockerfile versions it was located in `/`, we had to execute it with the absolute path `/ursa --help`. Pull the latest from the repository and build if you are finding you have to use the deprecated method. In any case, either running on Docker or a Host machine, make sure the directory location where the `ursa` binary is stored is declared in the system's PATH environment variable.

Executing the bash shell in the container is not mandatory and what we shared here is to demonstrate how to interact with the `ursa` process for the users that don't have it on their local machines and/or interested in checking subcommands, learning, following tutorials, etc in the same way someone who have it installed in their operating system would.

## Running a stack with Docker compose

We have defined a Stack üï∏ that can be useful for running and monitoring; At time of writing, this is declared in a docker-compose file located [here](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/cfbbe6208dc6a33d28b43c6e6820ab76c2905353/infra/ursa/docker-compose.yml).

There you'll find specified all the configuration options, such as the one's we've discussed in the previous topics about the host, port bindings, etc. You don't have to constantly verify if specified all the correct options when running the Docker containers. Plus, we have these setup for you [grafana](https://grafana.com/), [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/). Also, the docker compose file can be customised to your preference, Docker will detect any changes recreating the the container if and when necessary.

For the purpose of this guide üìí, we'll look into how to start and stop the stack only!

In the project root, execute the docker-compose command ü§ñ by providing the `docker-compose.yml` configuration file and the subcommand up.

```sh
docker-compose -f <DOCKER-COMPOSE-FILEPATH> <up | down>
```

For our use-case, here's how it'll look like:

```sh
docker-compose -f infra/ursa/docker-compose.yml up
```

Where for stopping, you have option `down`:

```sh
docker-compose -f infra/ursa/docker-compose.yml down
```

Here, we have an opinionated stack that you can use as base for your system, or as a reference, for your own research and learning. This means you aren't obligated to use Grafana or Prometheus.Ursa works without any dependency!

üí° Learn more about [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) by checking the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

If you'd like to use some of the points explained previously, such as to [execute bash shell in the container](#execute-bash-shell-in-the-container), you need to ensure that the [Docker compose file](https://github.com/fleek-network/ursa/blob/cfbbe6208dc6a33d28b43c6e6820ab76c2905353/infra/ursa/docker-compose.yml) have set the `container_name` to the name of your preference.

```sh
  ursa:
    container_name: ursa-cli
    build:
      context: ../../.
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: on-failure
```

## Conclusion

Containers are a way to have a self-contained environment that includes all necessary dependencies, libraries, software, etc, required to run an application üç∞.

Fleek Network's Ursa is developed with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a general-purpose programming language, that requires a number of dependencies and libraries to compile the project. Some of these libraries are not installed by default ü§ñ and require some troubleshooting to the end-user. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) provide us with containers, self-containing all the required libraries for the purpose of running Ursa, our application.

We guided you through the initial installation steps, how to build a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image, which then's used to Docker run a container. Plus, provided the lower-level commands, to help you understand other present or advanced use-cases, and also at higher level, oferring simple utility methods.
