News are coming to Fleek! In today's release, we've redesigned the app's authentication page, migrated Fleek to use our new Drip library using Radix & Stitches, and made a ton of UI/UX improvements to the app suggested by users!

Get ready, because we're working hard to **rebuild the Fleek experience and create a Web3 native app for everyone**. This first step will allow us to segway onto Web3 logins and payments (wallet integrations), and soon enough into a full-platform revamp.

Fleek's receiving a freshen-up, and we're starting with the authentication page. Whenever you sign up or sign in to Fleek, you'll be greeted with this new view!

The revamped authentication page uses the Drip library (read more below), and has an improved flow for email verification and GitHub account linking.

Not only does this page provide a **cleaner and up to 30% faster experience**, but it'll be the stepping stone upon which we add **a lot more Web3 native login options to Fleek.** 

### A Segway Into Web3 Options

This new design is the base layer upon which we'll bring **crypto wallet logins onto Fleek,** using [Sign in With Ethereum](https://login.xyz/) to allow Metamask, Gnosis, Rainbow, and other Ethereum wallet users to log in to Fleek.

Expect an update in the next week that will expand our folder of authentication providers to include these wallet options.
