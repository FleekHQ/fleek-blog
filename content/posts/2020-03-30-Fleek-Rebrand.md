We’re excited to announce that as of March 31, 2020, Terminal has rebranded to Fleek. 

As part of our rebranding, below are all the new names and accounts to use:
* Name: Fleek 
* Website: [fleek.co](https://fleek.co)
* Twitter: [FleekHQ](https://twitter.com/fleekHQ)
* Slack: [Community](https://join.slack.com/t/fleek-public/shared_invite/zt-bxna7y1d-PbVdut4rgHt5jM6Zjg9g9A)
* Email: support@fleek.co
* Company: Fleek Labs Inc.

Earlier this year we successfully launched a new platform, announced a new company direction, a new product roadmap focused around IPFS, etc. Everything about us was new, but we still had our old name, which made it feel like something was off. On top of that, while most users liked the name Terminal, there were a few users who let us know that they didn’t love the name and that they felt it might cause confusion given Terminal already has a separate and well established meaning in the developer world. One thing we take pride in as a company is listening to customer feedback and iterating accordingly, and this situation was no different. Given everything else about us was new, we felt a new name was the perfect way to fully complete our transition and best situate ourselves for the future. 

We love the name Fleek and we feel it’s a perfect fit for our current platform, product and future roadmap, so we hope you’ll love it as much as we do. It’s short, one syllable, fun to say, and most importantly it has no existing meaning in the developer world (but we definitely look forward to giving it one).

For users, the name change has no impact on the platform besides small cosmetic/design updates, so you can login and continue using the platform with your existing account as if nothing happened. Any existing tmnl.co subdomains you have in your account will still function as intended, and going forward any new sites you deploy will be given a fleek.co subdomain instead. The only other small changes are that emails will come from a fleek.co email from now on, and visiting terminal.co will auto-redirect you to fleek.co.

As we begin our future as Fleek, we’d like to take this opportunity to thank our amazing users for all the feedback and support thus far, because without you none of this would be possible. We’ve got some super exciting stuff on the roadmap this year and can’t wait to share it with you all.
