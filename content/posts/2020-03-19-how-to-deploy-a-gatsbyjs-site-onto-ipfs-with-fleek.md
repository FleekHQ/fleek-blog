Gatsby allows for the creation of static sites in a simple, straightforward manner. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a Gatsby project and deploy it to IPFS thanks to Fleek.

## Creating a Gatsby Project

Let’s start by installing the Gatsby CLI.

`npm i -g gatsby-cli`

Now we can create a Gatsby project.

`Gatsby new name_of_project`

This will create a new sample gatsby project which can be modified according to your needs. You can run `npm run develop` to see the page in the browser by going to http://localhost:8000.

For now, let’s make some changes to the basic starter site.

Beautiful!

## Deploying Through Fleek

We must create a github repository to store our site so Fleek can pick it up. For this tutorial, we will use the following repo:  https://github.com/SamueleA/gatsby-fleek

Now, we must log to Fleek and add a new site.

We select the github repo containing the Gatsby project.

Fleek will determine which build settings to use. It has automatically detected the Gatsby framework and filled the docker image with `fleek/gatsby`. This image has Gatsby installed with the latest node.js version. However, my gatsby app requires node 11, therefore I changed the docker image to `fleek/gatsby:node-11`.

Click on “DEPLOY SITE” to proceed to the next step.

You will be redirected to the site’s page. We must now wait for the site to be built and deployed.

Once the deployment is over the site can be accessed and shared. For this tutorial, the site can be seen here: <https://aged-paper-1829.on.fleek.co/>
