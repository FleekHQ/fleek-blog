Thought we'd take a break from news for a while after announcing [Static Frontend Hosting, a new Gateway, and Canister Proxying on the Internet Computer](https://blog.fleek.co/posts/to-dfinity-and-beyond-dfinity-frontend-hosting)? Well, not today.

We keep them updates coming ðŸ”¥ Today's release gives **developers a lot more control over their experience in Fleek**, especially over our Hosting suite of tools for building sites on the Open Web, and for integrating Fleek to other experiences:

* Hosting CLI
* GitHub Actions
* Fleek's GraphQL API
