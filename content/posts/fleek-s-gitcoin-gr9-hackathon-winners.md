Last week Gitcoin's Grant Round 9 Hackathon came to an end, with an inmense folder of dope projects and groups participating in another jampacked grant hackathon. The event wrapped with over 1.2 million raised by the community, and over $300k in hackathon prizes!

This year we didn't come alone. We teamed up with Protocol Labs, together with Textile, IPFS, and Filecoin to bring some cool Web3 challenges for hackers on GR9 take on, placing over $63k in Filecoin (FIL) prizes as a whole!

Two weeks after, and a couple dope projects later, it's time to take a look at the projects **that surprised us** **and** **took the win home this year!**

## The Challenge

What was our challenge? To build an app or Dapp **using Fleek's open source tools**. For example the [Space SDK](https://fleek.co/space-sdk/) open source library, or [Fleek's Storage JS](https://docs.fleek.co/storage/fleek-storage-js/) for interacting programatically with Fleek's IPFS storage.

We opened up three tracks, focused on **Innovation, NFTs, and Communication.** And judged based on originality of implementation, its quality, and good usability.

**What are the prize tiers?**

1st place: $2,000 + Protocol Labs matching  
2nd places: $1,000 + Protocol Labs matching
