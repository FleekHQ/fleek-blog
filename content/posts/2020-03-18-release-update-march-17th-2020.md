## Enhancements

### Concurrent builds
You can build multiple deployments at the same time within one site and across all sites.

### Domain Checkout
The domain checkout process is now charged to your added payment method instead of having to do one time check outs

### List of Sites and Deploys
Pagination has been added to the list of sites and list of deploys. You may have noticed if you had more than 20 of sites and/or deploys they get cut off, now you will be able to load as many as you need

##Bug Fixes     
* Sometimes after a successful deployment the autogenerated subdomain to preview he deployment wouldn't show until after a refresh. Fixed!
* The date and time on a previous deployment were showing up as "today MM/DD" if it was within 24 hrs even if it was the day before. Fixed!
* The same Git Repository connected to multiple sites sometimes failed to trigger the auto deploy successfully. Fixed!         
* In case the manual trigger of the redeploy fails, we improved the error message.
