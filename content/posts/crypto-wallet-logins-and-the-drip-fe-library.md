The day has come! As of today, you can sign up or sign in to Fleek with **an Ethereum wallet. Powered by Sign in With Ethereum, and built using the Drip component library for Web3 apps that we‚Äôre also open-sourcing today!**

We hinted at this release last week, with the authentication page overhaul, and today we‚Äôre not only releasing one option but four different Ethereum wallet authentication providers.  
It‚Äôs time to **welcome blockchain & crypto users into Fleek, the dApp way.**

This is the first of many steps towards a Web3 rehaul to Fleek, bringing you wallet-based accounts and soon a non-custodial first experience.

## Ethereum Authentication on Fleek ‚ö°

If you visit [app.fleek.co](https://app.fleek.co/), you‚Äôll find a new Sign in with Ethereum option, next to the Git or Email provider options!

For this new authentication option, we brought in **four main Ethereum provider options that you know and love:**

* MetaMask ü¶ä
* Rainbow üåà
* Wallet Connect ü§ù
* Gnosis Multi-Sig üîí

From any Web3 enthusiast or solo developer to DAOs or multi-sig that want decentralized control of their Fleek account and projects. We‚Äôre getting ready to welcome them all!

### Using MetaMask ü¶ä

With MetaMask, it takes a couple of clicks to use your extension wallet to authenticate to Fleek.

### Using Rainbow, Gnosis, or Wallet Connect üåà

For these three wallets, all it takes is a QR scan to get started!

Users can create **new wallet-only accounts; or use the flow shown below to link a wallet to an existing GitHub or email account:**
